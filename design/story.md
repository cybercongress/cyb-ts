As an adult human with strong intelligence I want to switch from google search and social medias so that:

- Answers and feeds are provable, comprehensive, and convenient for me
- Communications with friends are guaranteed and provably private
- I can contribute and have a fair share of the success
- My personal knowledge appear honestly in results without data locks and major privacy leaks
- Everything works offline on a mobile, desktop, terminal, and in virtual reality
- My switching experience is engaging, sexy, and fun! 
- The new place is new hope - the best portal to the amazing world of the Great Web
