## Проблематика

## Объектная модель 

  avatars can create neurons. Neurons creates cyberlinks. Cyberlinks are Data behond cyberlinks are deliver by providers. 
  - providers
  - particles

## Рантайм Васм


### Resources

In the core is the robust resource permissions signed by agent for every particle. Personal robots can be generated from the avatar's key for signing permissions for particles (local contracts).

- CPU time
- GPU time
- volatile memory
- persistent memory

- other websys resources

## Раст как язык

## ipfs и waku

## Ноды: bitcoin, ethereum, cosmos

## Терминальный интерфейс

## Components

Components can be overlaid over the space and can be toggles with hotkeys. Any app developer can reuse this components for apps.

- space. A place for exploration. Anything can be put here
- avatar. Image of a character identified by pubkeys.
- commander. A bar for search and command. Have past and future buttons.
- robot. Subordinate character of avatar which have its own pubkey derived from the avatar's pubkey. Avatar can cyberlink a program with robots. 
- assistant. Tool to optimizse call to actions. Actions either preprogrammed or suggest automagically.
- navigator. Tool to navigate across apps and within the apps. Collapsible tree with favicons can either auto suggest the structure or build it using some convention.
- timeline. A panel which display users actions both in past and looking into the future.
- particle: Auto show best answer + unraveled by xxx some days ago + answers / chat / backlinks
- signer. Conformation screen for signing messages. Background is secretly and deterministically generated based on the avatar for security.
- transformer. The tool for migration of content from web2.
