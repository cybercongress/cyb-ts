# cyb: dream of a robot

Immortal Robot for the Great Web

Cyb mission is to link and persist knowledge that allows everyone prosper.

Technically Cyb is a browser based on the idea of state transition function defined by cyberlink: signed transition from one state to another.

## Principles

- Ownership: No keys - No pussy
- Allegality: Because I can not care
- Nonviolence: Follow golden principle
- Consent: I respect you
- Privacy: Because we can
- Efficiency: If something can be done faster by the cost of energy efficiency it has not to be done
- Speed: Faster is always better than slow
- Offline: Travel in spacetime can not be imagined without offline first experience
- Modularity: I am limited set of concise interfaces
- Minimalizm: If you dont know why to add, do not add
- Wisdom: You educate me, I educate you
- Fun: Everyone loves games and tits
- Universal: I can work for humans, robots, animals, progs and other living forms

## Problems

...

## Object Model

- avatars can create neurons
- neurons sign messeges
- content identifiers of messeges are particles
- raw data behind particles are files
- files are exchanged by neurons
- neurons connect particles with cyberlinks
- cyberlinks form superintelligence
- avatars love superintelligence

## Sequentual Computations

wasm runtime based on [Lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic) and [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm)

## Parallel Computations

soft3 runtime based on [go-cyber](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber) and [WebGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)

### Resources

In the core is the robust resource permissions signed by agent for every particle.
Personal robots can be generated from the avatar's key for signing permissions for particles (local contracts).

- CPU time
- GPU time
- volatile memory
- persistent memory
- other websys resources

## Protocol and Implementation

Several implementations in Rust, Go, Python and JS

## Data and Messeging

ipfs & waku

## SPV nodes

bitcoin, ethereum, cosmos

## Rendering

[Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)

## Package manager

Using soft3

## Components

Components can be overlaid over the space and can be toggles with hotkeys. Any app developer can reuse this components for apps.

- space. A place for exploration. Anything can be put here
- avatar. Image of a character identified by pubkeys.
- commander. A bar for search and command. Have past and future buttons. Favorite button.
- robot. Subordinate character of avatar which have its own pubkey derived from the avatar's pubkey. Avatar can cyberlink a program with robots. 
- assistant. Tool to optimizse call to actions. Actions either preprogrammed or suggest automagically.
- navigator. Tool to navigate across apps and within the apps. Collapsible tree with favicons can either auto suggest the structure or build it using some convention.
- timeline. A panel which display users actions both in past and looking into the future.
- particle: Auto show best answer + unraveled by xxx some days ago + answers / chat / backlinks
- signer. Conformation screen for signing messages. Background is secretly and deterministically generated based on the avatar for security.
- transformer. The tool for migration of content from web2.

## Distribution and Interfaces

- osx
- linux
- windows
- chrome
- android
- vive
- daydream
- keyboard

## Buildings

Cyb helps to get familiar with the new universe using the concept of buildings. There are some basic buildings which are maintened by the cyb core with the simple idea: One app to rule them all.

## Lifetime of transaction

- proposed
- signed by me
- send
- received by my peers
- timestamped / executed / verified by consensus / failed to timestamped

## Audience

- nerds
- children
- women

### Core sparks

- uri
- video
- audio
- image
- text
- pdf
- signal
- step
- prog
- citizen

## Sound and Art

...

## Gamification

...

## Feedback

Feedback happens thanks to cyberlinks

### Transformer
- custom knowledge graph
- gbm: genesis bootstrap module
- site: url and depth
- archive: keyword
- pornhub: likes, tags
- wiki: complete
- google search: keyword
- gmail: folder
- drive: folder
- youtube: subscription, channel
- twitter: person
- github: stars, subscriptions, trending by tag
- telegram: group, channel
