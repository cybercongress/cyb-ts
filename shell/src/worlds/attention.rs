//! Attention is a link: where you go, and how long you stayed.
//!
//! Every world switch casts one weighted cyberlink,
//! `particle(world you left) → particle(world you entered)`, with the
//! seconds you dwelt in the old world as the link's amount. That one rule
//! does three jobs at once:
//!
//! - the log stops being blind to navigation — every transition is a line
//!   in the record, because it is a signal on the chain like everything else;
//! - the graph seeds itself from use. A fresh cyb needs no synthetic demo
//!   constellation: by the time you first open brain, your own movement has
//!   already drawn something true;
//! - the weights are the raw material for focus. mir's layout already pulls
//!   proportionally to link amount, so the worlds you live in drift together
//!   on screen today — and tru's ranking has honest attention data to chew
//!   on the day it lands.
//!
//! The unit is seconds, floor one: a glance still happened. This is the
//! smallest version of "time on page as a link parameter" — worlds are the
//! only pages cyb has today; when robot grows real pages, the same cast
//! works per page.
