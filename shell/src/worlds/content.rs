//! The local content store: particle → the bytes behind it.
//!
//! The cybergraph is the record, and it records *particles* — 32-byte
//! content hashes — and the links between them. It does not carry content,
//! and it must not: the graph gossips and converges, content is fetched by
//! hash from whoever holds it. On the network that store is IPFS; on this
//! machine it is `~/cyb/particles.jsonl`, append-only, one `{particle, text}`
//! object per line. soma-kernel writes the same file in the same format —
//! the store has two writers and one truth.
//!
//! Everything here is best-effort on the write side and total on the read
//! side: failing to remember a text must never break the act that produced
//! it, and any line the store does hold must come back intact.
