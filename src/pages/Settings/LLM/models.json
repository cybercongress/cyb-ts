These models were trained with Phi-3 datasets that include both synthetic data and the filtered, publicly available websites data, with a focus on high quality and reasoning-dense properties. Phi-3.5 Mini uses 3.8B parameters, and is a dense decoder-only transformer model using the same tokenizer as [Phi-3 Mini](/microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct).\n\nThe models underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures. When assessed against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3.5 models showcased robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.",

This large language model (LLM) is a fine-tuned version of Nemotron-4-340B-Base, designed for single and multi-turn chat use-cases with a 4,096 token context length.\n\nThe base model was pre-trained on 9 trillion tokens from diverse English texts, 50+ natural languages, and 40+ coding languages. The instruct model underwent additional alignment steps:\n\n1. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)\n2. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n3. Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO)\n\nThe alignment process used approximately 20K human-annotated samples, while 98% of the data for fine-tuning was synthetically generated. Detailed information about the synthetic data generation pipeline is available in the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.11704v1).",
